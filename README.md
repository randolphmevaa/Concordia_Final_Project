  ## Introduction
>**L**os Angeles is the second most populated city in the United State of America.
> For this final project, I gathered data from several webpages in order to help a client to find the best land in order to open a barbershop in Los Angeles, County.
> I will bring our client a neat map showing crime rates and land classified by price ranges.
> With this I will also add a DataFrame showing the population and their category by neighborhood after finding the closets neighborhood by land as our client is willing to find a barbershop with a good balance between crime rates, population and prices.

Here are the steps that I followed:
  1 - Data collection
  2 - Data Cleaning
  3 - Map Visualization

Has we are also looking for places with a good balance between least crimes rates and the most populated states, I add several layers to the finale map so we can notice zone by crime rates and where are our land located.
